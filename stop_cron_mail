(before date)
              All messages that were received before date; date must be in the form d[d]-mon-yyyy, where d[d] is the day of the month as one or two digits, mon is the name of the month—one of ‘Jan’, ‘Feb’, ‘Mar’, ‘Apr’,  ‘May’,  ‘Jun’,  ‘Jul’,
              ‘Aug’, ‘Sep’, ‘Oct’, ‘Nov’, or ‘Dec’, and yyyy is the year as four digits; e.g. "30-Aug-2004".
